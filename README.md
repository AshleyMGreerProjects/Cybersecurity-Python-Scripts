# My Cybersecurity Projects Repository

Welcome to my repository of small yet powerful cybersecurity projects! This repository is dedicated to showcasing a series of practical Python scripts that I have developed as part of my journey in cybersecurity. Each script is designed to address specific aspects of cybersecurity, from port scanning to file integrity checking.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts, each focused on a different area of cybersecurity. These scripts are intended to be educational tools and practical utilities that can be used for learning and demonstrating various cybersecurity concepts and techniques.

### 1. **Port Scanner**
A script to scan open ports on a target IP address, helping to identify potential entry points in a network.

### 2. **Password Strength Checker**
A tool to evaluate the strength of passwords based on length, character variety, and the inclusion of numbers and special characters.

### 3. **File Integrity Checker (SHA-256)**
This script generates and compares SHA-256 hashes of files to detect unauthorized changes, ensuring file integrity.

### 4. **Basic Encryption and Decryption Using Fernet**
A script that demonstrates symmetric encryption and decryption using the `cryptography` library, providing a simple way to secure sensitive data.

### 5. Network Scanner with a GUI  
This script allows users to input an IP address, MAC address, and specify a range of ports to scan for open connections. The application ensures secure operation by requiring admin access before it can be executed. Designed for quick network audits, it leverages multithreading to efficiently scan and report open ports within the specified range. 

This will serve as a repository for my small scale cybersecurity projects and will be updated periodically depending on when I develop new projects
